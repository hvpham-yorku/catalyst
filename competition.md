# Competition

We are looking to develop a software that provides a better Patient and Healthcare Professional interfacing system. Our system will target the needs for both sets of users and allow them to obtain the data they need most in an efficient and easy-to-use fashion.

## EDGE

The Edge healthcare managment software is one of the industry leading and most widely used softwares in North America. Targeted towards flexibility, it is easily implemented into big and small businesses alike. However, the program lacks any real interface for the patients that are being filed into the system. There is no easily accessible way for the patients to check results of their medical assessments or even find out which healthcare professional is in charge of their care.

## Weave

The Weave system is guided towards smaller practices with a deeper attention to detail and easier access by patients to view the most necessary information regarding their health. This same implementation is what makes their record tracking of assessments more difficult. Doctors thus have a harder time finding relevant records to current visual assessments, hindering efficieny and organization in the practice.

### What makes our Product Different

Catalyst is implemented with the user experience of both patients and medical practitioners in mind. Catalyst understands that the patient experience and transparency is equally as important as those handling their care. As such, it implements an interface where patients can access their visual assessments and see which healthcare professionals are in charge of their file. Assessments then get filed under the same patients and same medical practitioners to ensure quick access to relevant records to enhance efficiency. Doctors will have equal abilities to view their patients and all visuall assessments under their file with quicker access to relevant files listed under a patients record.

### How could changes be implemented

Edge and Weave have guided their development towards revenue and ratings. These systems are much more commonly used by healthcare professionals that view assessments everyday in compared to patients that go in for assessments infrequently. Very few programs provide accessible interfaces for patients so Edge has taken advantage of that fact and focused soley on the doctors rather than the patients. This could be easily resolved with the addition of a user interface where they can view their own assessments and results in detail through a simple interface that can be updated by medical professioanls. On the other hand, Weave can improve their systems by adding medical specifications to each assessments so future doctors can quickly find relevant information and result in a list of assessments rather than spending valuable time going through a long list of information with no correlation to the health concern at hand.
