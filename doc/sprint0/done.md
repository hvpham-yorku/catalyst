# Definition of Done

Our team has agreed upon the following standard and additional definitions of "done," which apply to all user stories in our backlog. The definition ensures that our work is complete, tested, and ready for deployment.

- **Code Implementation:** The feature is fully implemented, following clean code practices and using the existing naming conventions.
- **Peer Review:** The code has been reviewed and approved by at least one other team member, with feedback addressed during the pull request.
- **Unit Tests:** All new code is covered by unit tests with a coverage of 90% or higher.
- **Integration Tests:** Features requiring interaction with external components (e.g., database, email service) are tested using integration tests.
- **Documentation:** Public methods and complex logic are documented for clarity.
- **UI/UX Verification:** The user interface is reviewed to ensure it is user-friendly and meets design requirements.
- **Deployment Readiness:** The feature is packaged, and any necessary configurations or environment variables are documented for deployment.
