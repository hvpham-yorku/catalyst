## Team Organization (Roles)

- **Kevin**: Responsible for creating UI/UX, tracking project progress, setting up the frontend foundation (View), and creating the Team.md document.
- **Ali**: Focuses on research tasks, including creating user personas and analyzing competitors. Responsible for compiling competition analysis in the Competition.md document.
- **Barbod (Project Leader)**: Leads the project and oversees features. Responsible for summarizing project objectives, setting up the backend structure (Model and Controller), managing the product backlog, and maintaining the README.md file.

## Decision Making

Our team follows a collaborative decision-making process where key decisions are made through group discussions during daily meetings as well as frequent online group discussions. 
Each team member contributes to their area of responsibility and brings insights to the group. Decisions are finalized by an agreement from all members. Since Barbod is the project leader and has a deeper understanding of the project concept, 
he often introduces initial ideas and suggestions. Each team member then builds on his foundation. 

## Prioritizing User Stories

High-priority stories focused on delivering core functionality and addressing significant user needs. Kevin and Barbod collaborated closely to ensure that user-facing features aligned well with the technical architecture, while Aliâ€™s research into user personas and competitor features helped highlight the most crucial requirements. After creating all the product backlog items, we held a meeting on a Discord voice call, where we conducted up to two rounds of voting as a team to finalize the priority and size of each story. During this meeting, we also discussed the sequencing of the stories, as some features depended on the successful implementation of others.

## Meetings

The team holds daily scrum meetings to provide updates on what each member is currently working on, what they have completed, and any obstacles they are facing. This daily check-in helps keep everyone up-to-date and allows the team to address issues quickly. We also have frequent online discussions to collaborate on tasks in real-time and quickly resolve any questions or blockers. 


## Next Phase

In the next phase, we plan to complete the stories that focus on implementing CRUD features for the primary app resources: patient, optometrist, and assessment. We will also introduce basic login functionality, limited to the administrator, as user roles for other types have not yet been defined. In the subsequent sprint, we will create and implement user roles with appropriate authorizations to ensure user privacy and control access to user-specific functionalities.
