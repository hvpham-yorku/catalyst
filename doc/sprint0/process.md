## Team Organization (Roles)

**Team Members and Roles:**

- **Kevin**: Responsible for creating UI/UX, tracking project progress, setting up the frontend foundation (View), and creating the Team.md document.
- **Ali**: Focuses on research tasks, including creating user personas and analyzing competitors. Responsible for compiling competition analysis in the Competition.md document.

## Decision Making

Our team follows a collaborative decision-making process where key decisions are made through group discussions during daily meetings as well as frequent online group discussions. 
Each team member contributes to their area of responsibility and brings insights to the group. Decisions are finalized by an agreement from all members. Since Barbod is the project leader and has a deeper understanding of the project concept, 
he often introduces initial ideas and suggestions. Each team member then builds on his foundation. 


## Prioritizing User Stories
TODO
User stories are prioritized based on a combination of impact on the user experience and technical feasibility. High-priority stories are those that provide core functionality or address significant user needs. Kevin and Barbod work closely to ensure that user-facing features are aligned with technical capabilities, while Ali's research into user personas and competitor features helps in identifying the most critical needs.

## Meetings

The team holds daily scrum meetings to provide updates on what each member is currently working on, what they have completed, and any obstacles they are facing.
This daily check-in helps keep everyone up-to-date and allows the team to address issues quickly. 
We also have frequent online discussions to collaborate on tasks in real time and quickly resolve any questions or blockers. 


## Next Phase
TODO
In the next phase, we will focus on completing the foundational UI/UX and backend setup, ensuring smooth integration between the frontend and backend. We will also finalize our user stories and begin development of core features based on our prioritized list. Weekly updates will continue to track and address emerging challenges.
