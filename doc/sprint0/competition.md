# Competition

We aim to develop a software solution that enhances the interaction between patients and healthcare professionals. Our system is designed to address the needs of both user groups by facilitating efficient and intuitive access to essential data, all while prioritizing patient privacy.

## [ISCIS](https://www.ontario.ca/page/early-child-development)

Our main competitor and inspiration for this project is HCD-ISCIS, an application developed by Ontario Health. HCD-ISCIS is designed to store and manage critical medical data for programs such as Infant Hearing (IH), Blind and Low Vision (BLV), Preschool Speech and Language (PSL), and Healthy Babies and Healthy Children (HBHC). The platform allows healthcare professionals, i.e., service providers, manage a comprehensive record of newborn past assessments, service visits, and future recommendations. Additionally, HCD-ISCIS offers templates for various medical examinations corresponding to the aforementioned programs.

## EDGE

The Edge healthcare management software is one of the industry leading and most widely used applications in North America. Targeted towards flexibility, it is easily implemented into big and small businesses alike. However, the program lacks any real interface for the patients that are being filed into the system. There is no easily accessible way for the patients to check results of their medical assessments or even find out which healthcare professional is in charge of their care.

## Weave

The Weave system is guided towards smaller practices with a deeper attention to detail and easier access by patients to view the most necessary information regarding their health. This same implementation is what makes their record tracking of assessments more difficult. Doctors thus have a harder time finding relevant records to current visual assessments, hindering efficieny and organization in the practice.

### What makes our Product Different

Catalyst distinguishes itself by offering a unified interface that caters to both service providers and clients. Each user group can seamlessly access the application and view the information relevant and appropriate to them. Catalyst also introduces a communication feature between healthcare professionals. In future versions, this will evolve into a fully developed real-time chat functionality, enabling service providers to communicate effortlessly request information, and share patient data as needed. Importantly, Catalyst places a strong emphasis on patient privacy by ensuring that any document-sharing requests always require explicit patient approval, safeguarding their medical information throughout the process.

### How could changes be implemented

HCD-ISCIS primarily serves healthcare service providers, while patient access to medical records is not supported on the same platform. Additionally, there is no integrated request or document-sharing mechanism, so direct client interaction is not required, and patient information remains siloed. In contrast, platforms like Edge and Weave have directed their development efforts towards increasing revenue and ratings. These systems are predominantly tailored for healthcare professionals who review patient assessments daily, rather than for patients who only access their medical records occasionally.

Few applications provide accessible and user-friendly interfaces for patients, and Edge has capitalized on this by focusing solely on the needs of doctors, neglecting the patient experience. This gap could be addressed by incorporating a simple and intuitive user interface that allows patients to view their assessments and results, updated in real time by healthcare professionals. On the other hand, Weave could enhance its platform by incorporating medical specifications for each assessment, enabling future healthcare providers to quickly locate relevant results without sifting through extensive, unstructured data.

Lastly, both systems could greatly benefit from a fully developed chat functionality, enabling seamless communication between healthcare providers. However, implementing such a feature, while also ensuring strict privacy measures, would require substantial investment and careful planning from stakeholders.
