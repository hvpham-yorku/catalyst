# Release Planning Meeting

Participating Members: Barbod, Keven, Amir

## Meeting Details

### Sprint1

As discussed in sprint0, it was established that a medical personel and information system would be implemented to provide CRUD capabilities to authorized personel. The full scope of the project was to first create an interface where the administrator can create, view, update, and delete optometrist, patient, and visual assessment records from and to the database. This is in accordance with the first three user stories specified within our product backlog.

During this implementation, we also decided to further advance the development of the user interface to build a more comprehensive homepage so that an app user can better understand the functionaility. This portion was based on user story #19 described in our product backlog.

### Sprint2

Amongst our 20 user stories, we discussed realistic goals that can be achieved in the timeframe provided to complete the project. As a group, we decided that user stories #4-#10 would be the most important and realistic to implement throughout the course of this project. We believe that it is necessary to provide a login portal (user stories #4 and #5) for optometrists and patients that will allow them to gain access to the records and personal information within their level of authorization with the ability to update as needed (User stories #8, #9, and #10). It is a key feature in our program for optometrists to be able to create, read, update, and delete visual assessments associated with themselves to be able to maintain patient records (User story #7). In addition, we need the administrator to be able to create user records to manage access and onboarding for new users to the system (User story #6).
