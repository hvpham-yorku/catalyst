# Sprint 1 Planning Meeting

Participating Members: Barbod, Keven, Amir

## Goals and User Stories

The goals for this sprint were very simple and established early on. The deliverables for this sprint were to build the foundation of the larger project by focusing on user stories, #1, #2, #3, and #19. This would develop the basis for the CRUD systems required for the different authorization levels within the system (i.e. Administrators, Optometrists, and patients). Barbod, the team leader, proposed that it would make the most sense to implement the CRUD capabilities for the administrator first as they would have the the highest level of authorization. Administrators would also be the only ones that can add and initialize Optometrists so they were a necessity for the program to function at its most fundamental level.

Keven then purposed that it would also be a good idea to lay down the foundational elements of the front end interface as well, so that there is a a functioning interface that a user can interact with at the initial demo. It was agreed that this implementation would be centered around user story #19 from our product backlog to have a user guided goal.

## Roles and Task Distribution

We left it to Barbod, our group leader, to distribute our roles. He decided that due to his greater familiarity working with spring and springboot that he himself would work on the implementation of the administrator CRUD capabilities with help from Amir through pull requests. Keven was assigned to work on the UI/UX front end and, similarily, ask for any required help from Amir through pull requests. Amir was assigned to work on required documentation for sprint 1 while prioritizing any pull requests that are guven to him.
