# Catalyst

## Motivation
Healthcare professionals often spend significant time managing paperwork and administrative tasks.
This project, inspired by the name "Catalyst" (substance that facilitates reactions) aims to streamline these processes and enhance workflow efficiency.
Focusing on visual assessments and optometrists, our application enables optometrists to conveniently store, access, and securely share patient medical records, reducing administrative burden while prioritizing patient privacy.

## Contribution

We use GitHub Issues to represent user stories on our Trello board and to track project progress.

### Branching

Our branch naming convention uses kebab case and follows this format: `story-<story-number>`.

For each story, the branch is further subdivided into front-end and back-end branches:

- `story-<story-number>-frontend`
- `story-<story-number>-backend`

As developers complete their respective front-end or back-end tasks, they will merge their changes into the story branch. Once the entire feature is complete, the story branch will be merged into the `main` branch.

### Pull Request Process

Once an issue is complete, contributors submit a pull request and assign it to one of the following main developers for review:
- Amir Ali Mohaghegh ([AMoh1026](https://github.com/AMoh1026))
- Barbod Habibi ([BarbodH](https://github.com/BarbodH))
- Kevin Nguyen ([kevnngyen](https://github.com/kevnngyen))

After review and approval, the pull request is merged into the main branch.
