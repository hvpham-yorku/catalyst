# Sprint#1 Retro Meeting

_- ### Participants: 
  - Kevin Nguyen
  - Amir Ali Mohaghegh
  - Barbod Habibi
  
- ### Finished tasks/stories:
  - Story#1
  - Story#2
  - Story#19
    
- ### Unfinished tasks/stories:
  - Story#3
    - Will be moved to Sprint#2
    - Story#3 relied on the completion of Story#1 and Story#2
    - Both stories took a bit long to complete hence, leaving no time to do Story#3.
    - We should focus on Story#3 for the next sprint as it is a main feature.

- ### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?
  - Regular stand-up meetings to help keep the team aligned on task and progress
  - Code reviews
  - Clear task breakdowns among each-other before starting 

- ### What are new practices to consider for the next sprint?
  - We should try incorporating some sort of testing to help identify bugs
  - More of us should try to link our trello tickets when we create a pull request
  - More of us should try to assign priority levels to tickets we're going to do

- ### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1?
  - We all hated the time crunch
  - Our schedules prevented us to consistently work on sprint 1
  - Probably due to it being the end of the semester but we got through it:)
