- ### tasks/stories:
  - We completed most of the desired stories within the time limit of the project, however we were not able to implement account registration
  - Story#5 was one of the key components of our project we wished to finish to register and be able to change login information
  - The completed stories took longer to finish than expected hence the delay
  - We aim to work on future stories after project submission to be able to complete our project for personal benefits

- ### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?
  - Regular stand-up meetings to help keep the team aligned on task and progress
  - Code reviews and peer feedback on implementation and functionality
  - Clear task breakdowns among each-other before starting to maximize efficiency

- ### What are new practices to consider for the next sprint?
  - We should try incorporating some sort of testing to help identify bugs
  - More of us should try to link our trello tickets when we create a pull request
  - More of us should try to assign priority levels to tickets we're going to do
  - We should allow more full-stack collaboration for all members to work on front and backend development

- ### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2?
  - Being able to learn and work off of eachother's knowledge and perspectives
  - We all hated the lack of time to work more on the project
  - Our schedules prevented us to consistently work on the project as we neared the end of the semester
  - Despite the challenges we all learned a lot and had fun collaborating
