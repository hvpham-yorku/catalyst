# Sprint 2 Planning Meeting

Participating Members: Barbod, Amir, Keven

## Goals and User Stories

The goals for this sprint focus on implementing role-based access, user management, and personalized CRUD functionalities for assessments. These deliverables were identified as critical next steps in building a secure and role-specific experience for administrators, optometrists, and patients.

The following user stories were selected for this sprint:
- **#3**: Administrator capabilities to create, view, update, and delete visual assessment records to document, manage, and update patient assessments accurately.
- **#4**: Role-based login functionality for administrators, optometrists, and patients.
- **#6**: Administrator capabilities for creating user records (patients, optometrists, administrators).
- **#7**: Optometrist CRUD capabilities for their own assessment records.
- **#8**: Optometrist ability to view and update personal details.
- **#9**: Patient ability to read only their own assessment records.

Barbod emphasized that implementing role-based access (user story #4) is foundational for ensuring the appropriate authorization for all other features. Additionally, user management functionality (user story #6) will allow administrators to onboard new users, making it a top priority. 

Keven proposed that we continue building on the front-end foundation established in Sprint 1, assigning specific components for the user interface to ensure a visually cohesive system. It was agreed that a functional front end for login and role dashboards would guide the implementation of backend features for this sprint.

## Roles and Task Distribution

Barbod, the team leader, distributed roles for this sprint as follows:

- **Amir**: 
  - Front-end development for the login page.
  - Collaborate with Keven on user dashboards for each role.

- **Keven**: 
  - Front-end development for the optometrist assessment page.
  - Collaborate with Amir for styling consistency.

- **Barbod**: 
  - Back-end mapping for role-based login and user management.
  - Implementation of CRUD capabilities for optometrist and patient assessments.
  - Oversee pull requests and provide code reviews as needed.

Keven will focus on maintaining UI/UX standards while assisting Amir with front-end challenges as necessary.

This distribution ensures that both the front end and back end advance in parallel to deliver a role-based, functional system for Sprint 2.
